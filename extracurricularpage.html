					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as extra curricular activities go, I don't have or have had a job yet, (soon though) and am not involved in any after school activites. As far as hobbies, I like to learn different programming languages and experiment in different game engines for fun. I also like to play videogames with my friends. I have not done any community service or volunteer work, but if I had to, (which I do), it would most likely be the <i><a href="http://www.wccsi.org/sitepages/VOLUNTEER.html">WCCS Nutrition Senior Dining Site</a></i>, as it is a program that has you help cook food for the elderly, which I think would be a fun way to spend my community service hours. </p>

	<!--<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time, I like to play videogames online with my friends from Cousino, or alone. The games I enjoy playing are <a>Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup</a>, or DC:SS, and <a>League of Legends</a>, or LoL.</p>-->
